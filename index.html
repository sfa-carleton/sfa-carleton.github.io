  Hello, source code editor!

  The special filename "index" is what you access at the root of a website, without any `/whatever/foo.html` afterwards.

  The three-dash-delimited area above is called the "front matter." It must be at the top of the file if there is one and
  gives eleventy some more information about how to work with this file.
  This front matter says that this page should be inserted into the `wrapper.md` layout; layouts and includes are both
  in the _includes directory (yes, it's confusing).
  You write the front matter in YAML, a language sent by Satan to punish programmers. Hopefully you can just stick to
  easy key-value stuff.

  You may also notice I like writing each sentence on its own line. This is called "ventilated prose."

  I like it but you don't have to do so

  This is a Markdown file, by the way.

  Much easier than HTML!
