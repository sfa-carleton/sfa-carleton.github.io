# Captain's Log

Here's a log of all the shows we've watched and of all the goings-on at SFA.
This probably also includes events that aren't *technically* hosted by SFA but were still endorsed by us -- we are a lot less strict about this than we're supposed to be.

This log was started in Spring 2023, so older shows and events had to be gathered by hearsay and trawling through old emails.
Believe them at your own risk.

## Stardate Spring 2023

### Shows

- Lost In Space S2 (the Netflix remake)
- Legend of Vox Machina S2
- Jonathon Strange and Mr. Norell
- Star Trek: TNG
- Adventure Time

### Events

#### Special Interest Powerpoint Session

A no-preparation, no-stress opportunity to infodump to a captive audience.
We heard about `PoseStack`s, Carleton's very few ghost stories, kangaroo rats, extremely long-running Warrior Cats fanfiction, and crafting stuff out of felt.

#### Brandon Sanderson Cookies

Cookies were baked and insignias (semi)-successfully drawn on them in frosting.

### Events

#### Extra Shows

After voting, we watched **Tron: Legacy**. Many jokes about sexy, sexy knees were made after a club member noted how much the programs' uniforms accentuate their knees.

Here is what your benevolent webmaster wrote about such:

> A brief summary of the plot:
>
> In the original TRON, Kevin Flynn made a virtual reality called the Grid.
> Now, he's disappeared into it.
> His son Sam Flynn discovers how to get him back, and accidentally gets sucked the Grid.
> Kevin has been deposed, and Sam finds himself in a milataristic Grid, with mandatory bloodsport organized by a rogue program designed to be Kevin's personal assistant.
> Can Sam find his father?
> Can he restore order to the Grid?
> Can he even find his way back into the real world?
> Find out in TRON: Legacy!

> A brief summary of the special effects:
>

Our annual Halloween Feast. Your benevolent webmaster dressed up as Nikola Orsinov, from The Magnus Archives, and scared the everliving *shit* out of a bunch of kids.

![Petrichor Park as Nikola Orsinov, wearing a white theater mask, gloves, a blazer, cream stockings, and black short shorts. Her neck is covered with white face paint and the eyes of the mask are covered with gauze, so you cannot see any of her body. She is standing in an unnatural position, like a mannequin.](/static/img/captains-log/2022-fall/halloweenfeast-01.jpg)

#### S.A.B.E.R

Your benevolent webmaster (Petrichor) attempted to start S.A.B.E.R, the **S**FA **A**synchronous **B**ook-**E**njoying **R**eaders.
We got as far as voting on a book to read (*Klara and the Sun* by Kazuo Ishiguro), and then your benevolent webmaster got a bad case of No Executive function and it kind of fell through.
Oh well.

## Stardate Summer 2021

A non-standard non-trimester! Various activities were held over the summer; the thought was that because SFA was 100% remote these days, there's no reason to not keep doing it remote.

Here's what we did:

- Enchanter's Telephone, a game with instructions kept in the Benton library that your benevolent webmaster needs to digitize.
- Watching **Pacific Rim**
- Watching **The Wizard of Oz**
- Watching **Arrival**
- Bad Dramatic Readings
- Watching **Galaxy Quest**
- "Game Night" (apparently some manner of Jackbox; the email logs were not clear)
- Watching **Wolf Children**
- Slideshow Karaoke.
  > What is slideshow karaoke, you might ask? Fear not, I shall explain it: the SFA officers have put together many sets of Google Slides containing some very strange images. You, the presenter, will be given one of these slideshows you've never seen before and try your best to improvise a somewhat coherent presentation to go with them. Chaos and entertainment will ensue. If you don't want a turn to present, you're still welcome to show up to the meeting and watch your fellow SFA folks' inevitably hilarious attempts.
- Watching **Hocus Pocus**
- "A Game With No Name"
  > We have a list of characters. They are from various pieces of media that we have watched in SFA at some point or that we know many SFA folks are familiar with. We will also take suggestions for said list at the beginning of the meeting. Then we will randomly pick two characters from that list and debate what would happen if they were to meet. Would they be friends? Enemies? Who would win in a fight? All that and more is for you to decide. We will keep doing this with random sets of characters until we collectively decide we don't feel like doing it anymore.
- Watching **Dragonslayer** (1981)
- Bad Art Night
  > Before getting started on the art, we'll take a few minutes to collect prompts--the more open-to-interpretation, the better. We'll have a Google form to share with you all at the meeting for ease of submission. After collecting all the prompts we'll select one at random, then everyone who wants to draw will have a couple minutes to draw their interpretation of the prompt--don't worry about your drawing skills, it can be as poorly-drawn and/or as funny as you desire. Once the time limit is up, you can all share your drawings, and then we'll repeat for as long as we want to play. 
- Watching **Howl's Moving Castle**
- Multi-Event Wombo Combo
  > What event combo are we doing tonight, you might ask? Excellent question. You may recall Slideshow Karaoke, a game SFA has played in the past where you are given a slideshow of strange images and have to try to make them into a coherent presentation. We're doing that, but with a twist: you have to do your presentation about a randomly selected pair of fictional characters. (Don't worry, you can reroll if you get characters you don't know.) What do lobsters have to do with how Emperor Palpatine and Legolas might get along? That conundrum is exactly the sort of thing we'll have to make up answers to at tonight's event. Join us to give a very strange presentation, or just come watch your fellow SFA folks' efforts. After we're done with that, we can watch some videos, dramatically read infamous Internet posts at each other, or just hang out.

## Stardate Spring 2020

This is before your benevolent webmaster started attending SFA, so *really* stop believing things around this point.

Also all of this was done over Zoom.

### Shows

- The Future Is Wild
- Hilda
- Phineas and Ferb
- Babylon 5

After voting, we watched **Star Wars IV: A New Hope**.

## Stardate Winter Break 2019-2020

There were remote meetings held over winter break.

## Stardate Winter 2020

This is just about where your benevolent webmaster got really tired of trawling through old emails.
