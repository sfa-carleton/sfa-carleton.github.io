    Hello, source code editor!

    The special filename "index" is what you access at the root of a website, without any `/whatever/foo.html` afterwards.

    The three-dash-delimited area above is called the "front matter." It must be at the top of the file if there is one and
    gives eleventy some more information about how to work with this file.
    This front matter says that this page should be inserted into the `wrapper.md` layout; layouts and includes are both
    in the _includes directory (yes, it's confusing).
    You write the front matter in YAML, a language sent by Satan to punish programmers. Hopefully you can just stick to
    easy key-value stuff.

Welcome to the

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Carleton Science-Fiction Fantasy Alliance!</h1>

home page.

This is a work-in-progress remake of the old Wordpress site, hopefully easier to host and maintain.
