  Hello, source code editor!

  The special filename "index" is what you access at the root of a website, without any `/whatever/foo.html` afterwards.

  The three-dash-delimited area above is called the "front matter." It must be at the top of the file if there is one and
  gives eleventy some more information about how to work with this file.
  This front matter says that this page should be inserted into the `wrapper.md` layout; layouts and includes are both
  in the _includes directory (yes, it's confusing).
  You write the front matter in YAML, a language sent by Satan to punish programmers. Hopefully you can just stick to
  easy key-value stuff.

  You may also notice I like writing each sentence on its own line. This is called "ventilated prose."

  I like it but you don't have to do so

## Who are we?

We are people who like to explore imaginary worlds, with friends.
Usually that involves watching TV.

If you'd like to join, just show up! We generally host a meeting every Friday at about 6:30 at Benton House. We don't bite.
[Or, you can join the Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/carleton.edu/g/sfa.group), so you get weekly emails with the latest scoop.
(That rhymed completely incidentally.)

Current club leadership as of 2023-2024 is:

- Redacted Maxwell '23, the President.
- Petrichor Park '24, the Treasurer, webmaster, and generally most amazing and good-looking person alive.
- Lily Haas '24, the Vice President.
- Daphne Suh '24, the Vice Vice President.
